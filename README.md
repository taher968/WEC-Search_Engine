# WEC-Search_Engine

An educational search engine that allows you to filter out all the usual non-credible sources and hands you the most revelant information picked from the credible sources alone.
The stack involves:
* JavaScript
* HTML5/CSS
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* Request
* EJS

The API used was the Google Custom Search API and pulled data from various sources including:
* Khan Academy
* Symbolab
* Wolfram-Alpha

So just clone the repo, install the packages (using <code>npm i</code>), run <code>npm start</code> and <i title="Terms and Conditions apply">happy</i> searching! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
